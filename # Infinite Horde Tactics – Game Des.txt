# Infinite Horde Tactics – Game Design Document (Godot + Pixel Lab)

## 1. High-Level Pitch

- Top-down **auto-battler horde survival** built in **Godot 4**.
- You control a **squad of 5–6 units** on a **large continuous map**.
- The map is filled with **hundreds of visible enemies** at once – patrols, camps, swarms – not just spawns at the edge of your screen.
- Every enemy type can be **captured** and turned into a **recruitable character** mid-run.
- Characters come from **Pixel Lab**, giving you **effectively infinite unique sprites**; the game system maps those sprites onto a **finite but flexible rule set** (origins, classes, traits, abilities, tiers).
- Combat is **automatic**: units auto-attack using projectiles, beams, AOEs, etc. No attack animations needed; all the juice comes from **VFX and numbers**.
- Core gameplay: explore, kite big hordes, clear camps, **draft new characters**, create synergies, and try not to get overwhelmed.

## 2. Fantasy & Design Pillars

### 2.1 Infinite Pixel Lab Characters

- Pixel Lab generates **infinite static character sprites**.
- Each Pixel Lab sprite is treated as a **“visual shell”**.
- The game assigns dynamic data to each shell:
  - `origin` (e.g. Undead, Machine, Beast…)
  - `class` (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Guardian, Healer, Summoner…)
  - Allowed `tier` range (1–4)
  - `passive_trait`
  - `ability`
- A **small, tight rule set** + infinite sprites = enormous variety without manual balancing of every single individual.

### 2.2 Player Fantasy

- You are a commander in a hostile world.
- You **wade through huge hordes**, “harvesting” powerful individuals from the enemy ranks.
- Your squad is a bizarre collage of creatures you’ve captured and fused across runs.

### 2.3 Pillars

1. **Big Hordes, Big Map**  
   - You always **see** the danger in the distance: swarms moving, camps, patrols.

2. **Drafting & Synergy**  
   - The main fun is in **rolling, picking, merging and synergising** units.

3. **Simple Visuals, Strong Feedback**  
   - No attack animations required.  
   - Projectiles, AOEs, beams, hit flashes, numbers, and camera shake carry the impact.

## 3. Core Gameloop & Character Acquisition

### 3.1 Run Structure

Target run length: **20–30 minutes**.

#### 3.1.1 Early Game (0–3 min)

- Start with **3 basic units** (Tier 1).
- Spawn in a **low-threat zone** with sparse Tier-1 enemies.
- Explore, kill small packs, build:
  - **Capture Meter** (for drafts).
  - **Squad XP** (for global boosts).

#### 3.1.2 Mid Game (3–15 min)

- Move into **higher-threat zones**:
  - Denser enemies, Tier 2–3.
  - Enemy camps with nests and elites.
- Regularly earn:
  - **Capture Meter drafts**.
  - **Camp drafts**.
  - Occasional **shard / elite drafts**.
- Replace weak units, merge duplicates, build synergies.

#### 3.1.3 Late Game (15–30 min)

- Deep zones with **Tier 3–4 enemies** and very high density.
- Fight **mini-bosses and bosses**.
- Fewer, but higher-tier drafts.
- Eventually you’re overwhelmed, or you hit a milestone (e.g. clear final boss, reach time limit).

### 3.2 Character Acquisition – Detailed

You obtain new characters from **three main sources**:

1. **Capture Meter (main drip)**
2. **Camp Rewards**
3. **Boss & Elite Rewards**

#### 3.2.1 Capture Meter

- Global **Capture Meter** from `0` to `100`.
- Gain points from combat:
  - Normal enemy kill: `+capture_normal` (tunable, e.g. 1.5).
  - Elite enemy kill: `+capture_elite` (tunable, e.g. 10).
  - Camp cleared: `+capture_camp` (tunable, e.g. 15–20).
- When `CaptureMeter >= 100`:
  - Time slows or briefly pauses.
  - A **Recruit Draft** appears:
    - Shows **3 randomly rolled characters**.
  - Meter resets to `0`.

**Pacing target:**  
If the player is fighting efficiently, they should get **~1 Recruit Draft every 60–90 seconds**.  
Over a 20–30 minute run: **~10–20 drafts** from Capture alone.

**Recruit Draft rules:**

- Draft size: 3 characters.
- Tier distribution is based on **time/depth**:
  - Early (0–5 min): mostly Tier 1, small chance Tier 2.
  - Mid (5–15 min): Tier 2 common, chance Tier 3.
  - Late (15+ min): Tier 3 common, small chance Tier 4.
- Draft pool is biased towards:
